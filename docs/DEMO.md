## üé¨ Demo Script

### Opening (10 seconds)
*[Screen shows homepage with title and clean interface]*

**Narrator**: "Welcome to the Elliott Wave Analyzer - an educational tool that automatically detects Elliott Wave patterns and calculates Fibonacci levels for any stock symbol."

### Setup & Input (15 seconds)
*[Show control panel on left side]*

**Action**: 
1. Type "AAPL" in ticker input
2. Select "Daily" timeframe  
3. Keep "5y" range selected
4. Show ZigZag slider at 4%

**Narrator**: "Let's analyze Apple stock with 5 years of daily data. The ZigZag threshold at 4% will identify significant price swings for pattern recognition."

### Analysis Process (10 seconds)
*[Click "Analyze Waves" button]*

**Action**:
- Show loading spinner briefly
- Display "Analyzing..." message

**Narrator**: "The algorithm detects pivot points, enumerates wave sequences, validates Elliott Wave rules, and calculates confidence scores."

### Primary Results (25 seconds)
*[Results appear - focus on Primary tab]*

**Action**:
1. Highlight Primary tab with score (e.g., "Score: 78.5/100")
2. Point to wave labels on chart (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
3. Show Fibonacci retracement lines in yellow
4. Point to invalidation line in red

**Narrator**: "The primary count shows a 5-wave impulse pattern scoring 78.5 out of 100. Wave labels appear on pivot points, Fibonacci retracements show key support levels, and the red invalidation line indicates where this pattern would break down."

### Alternate Count Comparison (15 seconds)
*[Switch to Alternate tab]*

**Action**:
1. Click "Alternate" tab
2. Show lower score (e.g., "Score: 54.2/100")  
3. Highlight different wave labels (A, B, C)

**Narrator**: "The alternate interpretation suggests a corrective ABC pattern with a lower confidence score. This comparison helps traders consider multiple scenarios."

### Interactive Features (10 seconds)
*[Demonstrate chart controls]*

**Action**:
1. Toggle "Show Fibonacci Levels" off and on
2. Toggle "Show Invalidation" off and on
3. Hover over chart showing tooltip with price details

**Narrator**: "Interactive controls let you focus on specific analysis components. Tooltips provide exact price and date information for every data point."

### Export & Wrap-up (5 seconds)
*[Click Export button]*

**Action**: 
1. Click "Export Report" button
2. Show JSON file download beginning
3. Flash to disclaimer in footer

**Narrator**: "Export complete analysis as JSON for further study. Remember - this tool is for educational purposes only and not financial advice."

## üõ†Ô∏è Demo Setup Instructions

### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Backend server running on port 8000
- [ ] Frontend accessible at localhost:5173 or 3000
- [ ] Internet connection for yfinance data
- [ ] Browser with good screen recording capability
- [ ] Test AAPL analysis works (backup: SPY, TSLA)

### Backup Scenarios
**If AAPL fails**: Try SPY (usually very stable)
**If network issues**: Use pre-recorded analysis or synthetic data
**If scoring is low**: Explain that this demonstrates realistic analysis scenarios

### Technical Setup
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

# Start frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Browser Setup
- Use Chrome/Firefox for best compatibility
- Zoom level at 100% for clear recording
- Close unnecessary tabs and notifications
- Ensure good lighting for screen recording

## üìä Expected Demo Results

### Typical AAPL Analysis Results
- **Pivot Detection**: 15-25 pivots over 5 years
- **Primary Score**: Usually 60-80 range  
- **Pattern Type**: Often impulse on longer timeframes
- **Fibonacci Levels**: 3-5 retracement levels, 2-4 extensions

### What Makes a Good Demo
- **Clear Pattern Recognition**: Visible wave structure
- **Reasonable Scores**: Not perfect (unrealistic) but not terrible
- **Educational Moments**: Explain why certain scores occur
- **Interactive Elements**: Show the tool's flexibility

## üó£Ô∏è Presentation Tips

### Pacing
- **Speak Clearly**: Technical audience appreciates precision
- **Don't Rush**: 90 seconds is enough for key points
- **Pause for Loading**: Let the tool work, explain what's happening
- **End Strong**: Emphasize educational nature and disclaimer

### Troubleshooting Live Demo
**If analysis is slow**: "The algorithm is processing 1,300+ data points..."
**If score is low**: "This shows how the tool identifies weaker patterns..."  
**If pattern looks odd**: "Elliott Wave analysis can be subjective..."
**If technical issues**: Have pre-recorded backup ready

### Audience Engagement
- **Ask Questions**: "Who here has used Elliott Wave analysis?"
- **Explain Choices**: "We chose 4% because it's typical for daily charts..."
- **Show Alternatives**: "Let's see what happens with different settings..."
